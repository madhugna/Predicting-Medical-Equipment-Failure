# Predicting-Medical-Equipment-Failure

Project Overview

This project proposes a Healthcare CRM integrated with predictive analytics to monitor medical equipment performance, forecast potential failures, and trigger preventive maintenance.

System Role: The CRM acts as a central platform for collecting equipment data (usage hours, performance metrics, error logs, maintenance history) and applying predictive models.


Value:

-> Enhances patient safety by avoiding sudden device breakdowns.

-> Reduces downtime of critical machines like ventilators, MRI scanners, and dialysis machines.

-> Saves costs by shifting from reactive to preventive maintenance.

-> Provides decision-makers with actionable insights via dashboards and reports.

Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis

Objective:
To develop a predictive maintenance solution for critical hospital medical devices that minimizes equipment downtime, enhances patient safety, and optimizes operational costs by leveraging data-driven failure prediction, automated maintenance scheduling, and centralized monitoring dashboards.


Phase 2: Org Setup & Configuration

Objective:
To establish a fully configured Salesforce development environment by setting up a Salesforce Developer Org, integrating it with VS Code and Salesforce CLI, and connecting it to a version-controlled GitHub repository, ensuring a structured and collaborative foundation for building the healthcare equipment failure prediction solution.

Phase 3: Data Modeling & Relationships

Objective:
To design a robust Salesforce data model by creating custom objects, fields, and relationships that accurately represent medical devices, their usage logs, predictive failure insights, and maintenance tasksâ€”enabling seamless tracking, prediction, and management of equipment health within the healthcare CRM system.
