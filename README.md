# Predicting-Medical-Equipment-Failure

Project Overview

This project proposes a Healthcare CRM integrated with predictive analytics to monitor medical equipment performance, forecast potential failures, and trigger preventive maintenance.

System Role: The CRM acts as a central platform for collecting equipment data (usage hours, performance metrics, error logs, maintenance history) and applying predictive models.

Users: Hospital administrators, biomedical engineers, maintenance teams, and device manufacturers.

Value:

Enhances patient safety by avoiding sudden device breakdowns.

Reduces downtime of critical machines like ventilators, MRI scanners, and dialysis machines.

Saves costs by shifting from reactive to preventive maintenance.

Provides decision-makers with actionable insights via dashboards and reports.
